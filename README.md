# WoltDeliveries ( JAVA )
My project deals with representing a city and its customers who order food from restaurants, and couriers who deliver this food from the restaurant to the customers.
It also involves finding the shortest routes between customers and restaurants.
The project receives orders from restaurants and customers, and creates the shortest and fastest route between the restaurants and the customers.
